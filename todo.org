* Benefits Achieved

** Code Quality Improvements
- *Maintainability*: Each module has single responsibility
- *Testability*: Focused tests for specific functionality
- *Modularity*: Easy to extend or modify individual algorithms
- *Documentation*: Clear ABOUTME headers explaining purpose

** Medical SaaS Readiness
- *Safety*: Explicit parameter validation for medical use
- *Compliance*: Audit trail preservation for clinic documentation
- *Reliability*: Deterministic results for patient treatment tracking
- *Scalability*: Modular architecture supports multi-tenant SaaS

** Hair Clinic Workflow Support
- *Algorithm Flexibility*: Multiple transfer methods for different use cases
- *Before/After Processing*: Targeted transfer optimized for medical imaging
- *Quality Assurance*: Comprehensive testing ensures clinical reliability
- *Integration Ready*: Clean API surface for Flask/web integration

* Next Steps for Canva App Integration

** DONE Canva App Template Selection
CLOSED: [2025-01-19]
- [X] Research Canva Apps platform (Apps SDK vs Connect APIs)
- [X] Evaluate template options: Digital Asset Management, Data Connector, Generative AI
- [X] **SELECTED: Generative AI Template** - Best fit for skin-tone palette transfer

*** Why Generative AI Template (not Digital Asset Management or Data Connector):
- *Image Processing Workflow*: Perfect for upload → process → insert workflow
- *AI-powered Transformation*: Aligns with clinic expectation of "smart" enhancement  
- *Real-time Processing*: Fits Canva's quick AI response expectations
- *Before/After Standardization*: User uploads both images, backend applies skin-tone transfer, returns processed images

*** Why NOT the other templates:
- *Digital Asset Management*: For browsing/organizing existing assets, not processing
- *Data Connector*: For pulling data/content from external systems, not image transformation

** TODO Canva App Backend API Design
- [ ] Create Flask API endpoints for Canva integration
- [ ] Design `/api/v1/palette-transfer` endpoint (POST with before/after images)
- [ ] Implement image upload handling with medical validation
- [ ] Return processed images with standardized skin tones

** TODO Canva App Frontend Development  
- [ ] Set up Canva Apps SDK development environment
- [ ] Implement Generative AI template with skin-tone processing

- [ ] Test integration with local Flask backend

** TODO Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test Canva app with real clinic before/after photos
- [ ] Validate skin-tone standardization quality
- [ ] Performance testing with typical image sizes
- [ ] User experience testing with clinic marketing teams

* Future SaaS Development (Post-Canva Integration)

** TODO Web API Integration
- [ ] Create Flask application structure
- [ ] Implement RESTful endpoints for each algorithm
- [ ] Add clinic authentication and multi-tenancy
- [ ] Integrate with database for patient image tracking

** TODO Production Deployment
- [ ] Container configuration for medical compliance
- [ ] Error monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Performance optimization for batch processing
- [ ] HIPAA-adjacent compliance implementation

** TODO Clinical Validation
- [ ] Test with actual hair clinic workflows
- [ ] Validate algorithm parameters with medical professionals
- [ ] Performance benchmarking with realistic image sizes
- [ ] User acceptance testing with clinic staff

** TODO Algorithm Quality Review [2025-01-19]
- [ ] Review color transfer quality issues identified with leeheungjae test images
- [ ] Analyze poor image/colour transfer results from init_img_9040.jpg → final_img_1817.jpg
- [ ] Investigate targeted Reinhard algorithm parameters (skin:0.9, hair:0.5, bg:0.3)
- [ ] Consider alternative algorithms or parameter tuning for better results
- [ ] Test with different blend factor combinations for improved quality

** TODO Flask Integration & Deployment [2025-01-20]
- [X] Successfully integrate Canva app with Flask backend
- [X] Fix Python import issues in targeted_transfer.py module
- [X] Test local Flask development server (running on http://127.0.0.1:5000)
- [ ] Fix pkg_resources deprecation warning from face-recognition dependency
  - NOTE: pkg_resources deprecated by setuptools, removal planned 2025-11-30
  - OPTIONS: 1) Pin setuptools<81, 2) Switch to mediapipe/opencv, 3) Wait for face-recognition update
  - STATUS: Warning doesn't break functionality, Flask integration working perfectly
- [ ] Configure for Railway deployment with proper WSGI server
- [ ] Test production deployment of integrated Flask + Canva app
